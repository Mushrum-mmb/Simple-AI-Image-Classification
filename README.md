### üöÄ About

This AI application performs image classification using deep learning. Trained on my private datasets with the ResNet-18 model, it accurately predicts various animal categories. Users can upload images and receive predictions along with confidence scores.

* Author: [Mushrum-mmb](https://github.com/Mushrum-mmb/)
* Model: [resnet18](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet18.html)

### üéì Features
* Image Classification:
The application allows users to upload images for classification into specific animal categories.
* Pre-trained Model:
Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-18 model fine-tuned for classifying various animals.
* Real-time Inference:
Provides real-time feedback by displaying the predicted class and its confidence percentage upon image upload.
* Device Compatibility:
Automatically uses GPU acceleration if available, ensuring faster inference times.
* Easy Deployment:
The Gradio interface can be launched with a simple command, and the share=True option allows sharing the interface with others via a public link.
